What is Fedify?
===============

Fedify is a TypeScript library for building federated server apps
powered by [ActivityPub] and other standards, so-called [fediverse].[^1]
It aims to eliminate the complexity and redundant boilerplate code when
building a federated server app, so that you can focus on your business logic
and user experience.

Currently, Fedify provides the following features out of the box:

 -  Type-safe objects for [Activity Vocabulary] (including some vendor-specific
    extensions)
 -  [WebFinger] client and server
 -  [HTTP Signatures]
 -  [Object Integrity Proofs][FEP-8b32] & [Linked Data Signatures]
 -  Middlewares for handling webhooks
 -  [NodeInfo] protocol
 -  Special touch for interoperability with Mastodon and few other popular
    fediverse software
 -  [Integration with various web frameworks](./manual/integration.md)
 -  [CLI toolchain for testing and debugging](./cli.md)
