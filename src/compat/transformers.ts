/**
 * An activity transformer that assigns a new random ID to an activity if it

 *
 * ```
 * urn:uuid:12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678
 * ```
 * @typeParam TContextData The type of the context data.
 * @param activity The activity to assign an ID to.
 * @param context The context of the activity.
 * @return The activity with an ID assigned.

/**
 * An activity transformer that dehydrates the actor property of an activity
 * so that it only contains the actor's URI.  For example, suppose we have an
 * activity like this:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { Follow, Person } from "@fedify/fedify/vocab";
 * const input = new Follow({
 *   id: new URL("http://example.com/activities/1"),
 *   actor: new Person({
 *     id: new URL("http://example.com/actors/1"),
 *     name: "Alice",
 *     preferredUsername: "alice",
 *   }),
 *   object: new Person({
 *     id: new URL("http://example.com/actors/2"),
 *     name: "Bob",
 *     preferredUsername: "bob",
 *   }),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The result of applying this transformer would be:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { Follow, Person } from "@fedify/fedify/vocab";
 * const output = new Follow({
 *   id: new URL("http://example.com/activities/1"),
 *   actor: new URL("http://example.com/actors/1"),
 *   object: new Person({
 *     id: new URL("http://example.com/actors/2"),
 *     name: "Bob",
 *     preferredUsername: "bob",
 *   }),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * As some ActivityPub implementations like Threads fail to deal with inlined
 * actor objects, this transformer can be used to work around this issue.
 * @typeParam TContextData The type of the context data.
 * @param activity The activity to dehydrate the actor property of.
 * @param context The context of the activity.
 * @returns The dehydrated activity.
 * @since 1.4.0
