  Represents a question being asked.  Question objects are an extension of
  {@link IntransitiveActivity}.  That is, the Question object is an Activity,
  but the direct object is the question itself and therefore it would not
  contain an `object` property.

  Either of the `inclusiveOptions` and `exclusiveOptions` properties *may* be
  used to express possible answers, but a Question object *must not* have both
  properties.

    The URI of the ActivityStreams object that this object quotes.

    This property sets three JSON-LD properties at once under the hood:

    1. https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#quoteUrl
    2. https://misskey-hub.net/ns#_misskey_quote
    3. http://fedibird.com/ns#quoteUri

    When a JSON-LD object is parsed, this property is filled with one of
    the values of those three properties in order.
  range:
  - "fedify:url"
