description: |
  Indicates that the `actor` is undoing the `object`.  In most cases,
  the `object` will be an {@link Activity} describing some previously performed
  action (for instance, a person may have previously "liked" an article but,
  for whatever reason, might choose to undo that like at some later point in
  time).

  The `target` and `origin` typically have no defined meaning.
